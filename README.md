# ComputerCraft CDN
A read-only host-agnostic file system for distributing content across
ComputerCraft computers. Initially developed as a music player, it has
since expanded into a versatile file sharing application.

## Installation
All you have to do is run the following on your ComputerCraft computer:
```pastebin run jEAyuG5g```

Due to the integrated nature of pastebin into ComputerCraft in contrast to
github, a bootstrap script was needed to download and run the actual installer
script from this repository. That bootstrap script can be found in
[bootstrap.lua](bootstrap.lua). Updating the pastebin entry every time the
installer script needs changing would not be ideal.
